    <h1>Noted</h1>
    <h2>a simple proof of concept for react, golang</h2>

    <p>
      This page is a simple entry point to a dumb task list. This site uses 
      mainly <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> on the client, 
      and <a href="http://golang.org">go</a> on the server to test how the 
      two might be able to play together. In addition, I also toyed with the 
      build system <a href="http://gulpjs.com">gulp</a>, as well as 
      <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>, 
      <a href="http://browsersync.io/">browsersync.io</a> and some other toys.
